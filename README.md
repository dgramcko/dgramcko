- 👋 Hi, I’m Dean.
- 👀 I’m interested in Application Software Development, large scale Linux System Administration, and DevOps
- I love Linux and solving technical problems with software and automation.
- My primary development experience is with Java, Python, BASH scripting, SQL / relational databases, with previous experience in Javascript / NashHorn (+ html, CSS, etc for webapp development), as well as projects in C, C++, PHP, and minor experience with Docker, Flask, and Node.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PERL, interested in Rust, and never stop learning about Linux
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above :)
- 📫 dean.gramcko@intel.com
